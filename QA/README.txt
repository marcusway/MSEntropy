These scripts were all used to visualize differences between 
different groups.  inner_vs_outer.py compares the MSE curves
for inner electrodes (near the center) vs outer electrodes
as a proxy for differences introuded by movement artifact. 
high_vs_low_samp compared the MSE curves of subjects whose MSE
was calculated from time series collected at 500Hz frequency 
to curves of subjects whose time series data was collected at
250Hz.  These are fairly ad hoc, but the conditions used to 
group subjects can easily be manipulated to plot MSE differences
between different groups of interest.
